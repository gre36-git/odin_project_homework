/*
    Write a program that allows the user to enter a number, print each number between one and the 
    number the user entered, but for numbers that divide by three without a remainder print Fizz instead. 
    For numbers that divide by 5 without a remainder print Buzz and finally for numbers that divide by both 
    three and five without a remainder print FizzBuzz.

When a user inputs a number
Loop from 1 to the entered number
If the current number is divisible by 3 then print "Fizz"
If the current number is divisible by 5 then print "Buzz"
If the current number is divisible by 3 and 5 then print "FizzBuzz"
Otherwise print the current number
*/

//subproblem 1: recieving input from the user:
let answer = parseInt(prompt("Please enter the number you would like to FizzBuzz up to: "));

for (let i = 1; i <= answer; i++) {
  if (i % 3 && i % 5 ===0) {
    console.log('fizzBuzz');
  }else if (i % 3 === 0) {
    console.log("Fizz");
  } else if (i % 5 ===0) {
    console.log('buzz');
  }else {
    console.log(i);
  }
